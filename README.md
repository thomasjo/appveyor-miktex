# Portable MiKTeX installation

## What is this thing?
A simple set of tools for creating and packaging a portable MiKTeX installation.
The penultimate goal as of right now, is to provide alternative LaTeX support
to AppVeyor CI builds of [atom-latex](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex).
And as such, the packaged installation only targets win32.
